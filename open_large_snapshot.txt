1) install postgres.app
https://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html

2) Create Schema ---
psql -U nbuild -d nbuild -h localhost -p 5432 -c 'CREATE SCHEMA nbuild_[slug];'

3) Run this at your terminal to get the number of logical cores on your machine:
sysctl -n hw.ncpu

I had 5 cores in my machine. So I ended up claiming 2 for the pg_restore since i didn't want to redline my cpu. You can add the flag -j # to your restore to claim the number of cores you desire.

4) Restore Schema ---
pg_restore -U nbuild -d nbuild -h localhost -p 5432 -j [#of_cores] --schema nbuild_[slug] --verbose [backupfilename]
make sure you're running restore on the directory that your backup is in for the above to work.

5) Let restore run. Mine took about an hour.

6) Visit schema as you normally would on pgadmin :slightly_smiling_face:
